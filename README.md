- Hi, I’m @CaSulfate
- I’m interested in ... game development (Software Dev, level design, some art)
- I’m currently learning ... everything.
- I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing really.  If I want to work on your project I will probably bother you.  Chances are I don't.  Your software is probably OOP garbage that I would rather pretend didn't exist.
- How to reach me ... you don't, unless you already know how, in which case you probably met me offline.
